            Push off, and sitting well in order smite
            The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
            To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
            Of all the western stars, until I die.
            It may be that the gulfs will wash us down,
            It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
            And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
            Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
            We are not now that strength which in old days
            Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
            One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
            Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will`,
